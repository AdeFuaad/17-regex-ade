Demystifying Email Validation with Regular Expressions

In this tutorial, we'll explore a regular expression (regex) pattern used for validating email addresses, breaking down its components to help you understand how it functions and how you can use regex in your web development projects.



Summary

We'll discuss a regex pattern for validating email addresses, ensuring they adhere to a general format such as username@domain.extension. The regex we'll be examining is:

/^[\w.!#$%&'+-/=?^_`{|}~]+@[\w-]+(?:.[\w-]+)$/

Introduction to Regex <a name="introduction-to-regex"></a>

A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's a powerful tool for pattern matching and can be used in a variety of situations, such as searching for specific strings in a text, validating user input, or extracting specific information from a text. In this tutorial, we'll focus on a specific regex pattern used for validating email addresses.



Anchors <a name="anchors"></a>

^ and $ are start and end anchors, respectively. They ensure that the pattern matches the entire string, from the beginning to the end.



Local Part <a name="local-part"></a>

[\w.!#$%&'*+-/=?^_{|}~]+` matches the local part of the email address (username). This pattern allows alphanumeric characters, as well as various special characters.



At Sign (@) <a name="at-sign"></a>

@ is a literal character that matches the at sign (@) in the email address, separating the local part from the domain part.



Domain Part <a name="domain-part"></a>

[\w-]+ matches the domain part of the email address. This pattern allows alphanumeric characters and hyphens.



Top-Level Domain <a name="top-level-domain"></a>

(?:\.[\w-]+)* matches the top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org) and any subdomains. This pattern allows alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and periods.



Examples and Testing <a name="examples-and-testing"></a>

Now that we've broken down the regex, let's test it with some sample email addresses:



Valid: adesholafuaad@example.com
Invalid: adesholafuaad@example..com
Valid: adesholafuaad@example.co.uk
Invalid: adesholafuaad@.example.com



You can test this regex using various online regex testers or by implementing it in your JavaScript code.
